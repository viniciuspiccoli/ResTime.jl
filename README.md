#ResTime
ResTime is a simple package to compute probability survival functions from molecular dynamics simulations (MD). These functions can be used to calculate the residence time of different solvent molecules in  MD trajectories. The general algorithm was based on the following two articles: [Link1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1301175/) and [Link2](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.540141116)
